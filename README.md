### Running the client
The client is build by using Angular. Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x. 
To check which version you have run `node -v` in terminal.
If you dont have Node.js, go to [nodejs.org](nodejs.org)

If you dont't have Angular CLI installed, install it globally by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

Move to the client folder `cd client/`

Install dependecies `npm install`

Now you can compile and run the client locally by running `ng serve`. Open your browser in `http://localhost:4200`.
